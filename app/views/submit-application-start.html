            You can only use this service if any claim for interest is made at the
            same rate and from the same date. To claim interest at different rates or for
            different periods of time, you should issue a claim on paper. More information
            on how to do this can be found at<a href="#"> Make a court claim for money: make a claim - GOV.UK
